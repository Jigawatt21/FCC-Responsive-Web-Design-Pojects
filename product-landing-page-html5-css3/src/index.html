  <h2>We Never Close!</h2>
  <p> We support everyone's dreams, especially those who need coffee to help them get through the night! </p>
  <p>Everyone loves Coffee, and Screamin' Beans fills the air with succulent aromas as soon as you are within a three-mile radius of the brewing pot. The beans themselves do not scream, but their flavor screams quality.. that you can smell.</p>
  <p>At Screamin' Beans, it is our goal to make sure everyone has the opportunity to stay awake and chase their dreams in the real world, and not while they sleep. Achieving your dreams in your sleep is no accomplishment whatsoever, so we drink coffee to stay awake and continue to chase dreams in real life. Enjoy living like you're dreaming with our hand-curated product. Legally, we are not allowed to tell you how much caffeine comes in one cup of our coffee, because your energy levels will be off the roof!</p>
