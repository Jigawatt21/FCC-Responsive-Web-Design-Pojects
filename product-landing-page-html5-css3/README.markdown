This website was the third site I made to complete my Responsive Web Design Certification. I learned a lot from this one. I learned about how to make every single aspect of a site more interactive and interesting in this one. I learned about making static background images with a body of information that scrolls over top of it, I learned how to make a static nav-bar at the top of the screen. I also learned how to make everything react better on a mobile screen rather than working well on just wider screens. These tools, although I had learned and practiced them a bit during the freeCodeCamp courses, were generally solidified by this excercise. Completing this site, I felt extremely ready to take on a new and more advanced challenge in web-development.
