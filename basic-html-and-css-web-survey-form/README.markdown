This is the second website I ever made! Realistically, this site isn't much better than my tribute page for Isaac Newton. I did make it more responsive and worked in quite a bit more detail in the little things. Each of the buttons and each section acts differently and has a totally different feel to it than the Newton tribute page. Upon hover, the sections change colors, the borders around everything. I really just had some fun with the sizes of each element in this site and arranging them in different ways with CSS Flexbox and CSS grid.
