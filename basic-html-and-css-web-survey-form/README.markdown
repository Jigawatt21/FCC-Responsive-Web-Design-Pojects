# Basic HTML and CSS Web Survey Form

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/Mindhaxx/pen/GRqYzjY](https://codepen.io/Mindhaxx/pen/GRqYzjY).

This is really one of the first websites I ever made. This site challenged me to understand basic HTML and CSS to just create a very simple web-page. Making it responsive was another story, and that was never actually completed. It is responsive mostly by very basic CSS rules, but the stylesheet uses no media queries to get it done. In my opinion, the responsiveness is limited because of this. Regardless, this site is a landmark to me because it was the first time I tried to completely wing something in programming and it worked out just fine. I had followed along with tutorials in the past to get many things done, but this website was the starting point of me doing things for myself from then on. 

The next website I created just a few days later was the survey page. Go check that one out if you'd like or if you have the time!
